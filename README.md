# Internship Report

This repository contains my project report on **Modelling Slow granular flow**, guided by **Prof. Prabhu R Nott, Indian Institute of Science(IISc), Bengaluru** (Mayâ€“July 2025).

# Overview:
- Implemented a **non-local constitutive model** to characterize granular flow behavior in the intermediate regime.  
- Estimated **model parameters** by minimizing RMSE between model predictions and DEM (Discrete Element Method) simulation data.  
- Obtained **numerical solutions of non-linear coupled PDEs** using the Finite Difference Method (FDM) and compared results with DEM data.  

## Future Work
- Extend the Dsouzaâ€“Nott model to the intermediate inertial regime in order to better understand and interpret the model behavior in these flow regimes.
