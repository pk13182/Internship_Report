# Overview:
- Implemented a **non-local constitutive model** to characterize granular flow behavior in the intermediate regime.  
- Estimated **model parameters** by minimizing RMSE between model predictions and DEM (Discrete Element Method) simulation data.  
- Obtained **numerical solutions of non-linear coupled PDEs** using the Finite Difference Method (FDM) and compared results with DEM data.
